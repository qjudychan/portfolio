	<h3>Designing a point of sale system using the Carbon stablecoin network</h3>

	<p>The following reflects a point of sale system that offers two alternative mobile-based methods for the buyer to select from, eliminating the need for the merchant to have chip readers, swipers, scanners, etc.</p>

	<p>Buyers can select from:
		<ul> 
			<li><b>Option A - Engage with Custom QR Code:</b>
				<ol>
				<p><li>The system will generate a unique QR code for the transaction</li></p>
					<img src="source/Prototype1.gif" class="prototype">
				<br><br>
				<p><li>Buyer scans the code using their smartphone, either through a Carbon native app or through their camera app, if possible (e.g. on iOS 11 and later), which can link them directly to the native app</li></p>
				<img src="source/Prototype2.gif" class="prototype">
				</ol>
			</li>
			<br><br><br>
			<li>
				<b>Option B - Numerical Two-Step Verification:</b>
				<p>This option accomodates those without a smartphone, those with a smartphone but no data plan, or those with a smartphone that has a broken camera</p>

				<ol>
				<p><li>Buyer enters their phone number so that the system can send a custom generated numerical code for the transaction</li></p>
				<img src="source/Prototype3.gif" class="prototype">
				<br><br>
				<p><li>A code is texted to the phone number entered; the text message will also provide a link that the user can tap on to complete the transaction in the Carbon app</li></p>

				<p><li>Buyer inputs the code that was texted to them; alternatively, the user could tap the link in the text to avoid having to manually type the code, which would make the transaction less error prone and more efficient</li></p>

				<br><br>

				</ol>
			</li>

		</ul>
